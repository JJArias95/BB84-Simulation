=========================

Simulation 1:Distribution of bits in the raw key list, bases 
             in the RanBases list, matching and non-matching bases 
             between Alice's and Bob's bases in the RanBases list,
             and Qbits in the Qbits list.

Length of the Rawkey: 600
Number of simulations: 500

=========================

Ejercicio 2: Evolution of the complete Qber with respect to the length  
             of the RawKey With a probability of Eve appearing on the communication.

Maximum length of the Rawkey: 1000
Number of simulations: 3
Probability of Eve: 1
